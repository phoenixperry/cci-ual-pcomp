##Final Project 
50% of your total mark

The Major Project must represent a conceptual exploration of the intellectual material presented in this course. Care about the why, the what and the how in that order. 

For next week make sure you fill out [the final project proposal form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xClkjH8We0e4y3fugnWNEa_IpvLdCKxAiyTVLgfCWbdUNk1FVFA4QTBOTkNUS1c0RFZKMFNNNTY5WS4u)

*You will present your ideas next week in class and get approval or notes then.*


###You will be assessed on the criteria below. 

* Your project must be an original idea that explores an interesting relationship with the player/audience (30%)
 
---
	To get this 30% of the mark it must:

	* Use at least two INPUTS in any combination: two digital, two analogue, or one of each (no inputs = FAIL)

	* Use at least two OUTPUTS such as: an actuator of any type OR an on-screen display (no outputs = FAIL)
	
	* Be soldered to perf or strip board. (breadboards = Automatic FAIL)

--- 

* Have a suitable housing (up to 20% of mark)

* Include a detailed log, with entries for each week that you are working on the project (Weeks 6-9), including text, code, photos and schematics, where relevant. This should be one mark down file in your repo with each week as a h2 in markdown. (up to 10% of mark)

* Include a final presentation, consisting of a PDF of at least 5 slides and a short presentation and a short video on YouTube (submit a link) of less than 3 minutes describing the project and demonstrating how it works. Push this to your repo on the day of submission before class (20% of mark)

* Be exhibited in class unless other arrangements are made ahead of time (20%)

#### Final presentation notes: 

Prepare the following to share in class during the last lab of the term in the form of a presentation with slides. In the sides: 

* Set up the project. Tell us the story of why you are doing what you are doing. What are you investigating? What inspired you? What is the social context the project operates within?

* Give a short narrative list detailing your objectives 

* Show at least 2 images on the same slide of your project in progress.

* If appropriate, a video of your project with narrative voice over can be used as well 

* Tell what challenges you overcame

* Show a circuit diagram for your hardware. The image must be made in a circuit diagram program (eagle, kicad, fritzing). Illustrator or similar programs ARE NOT allowed. 

* You must physically show the project in class on your presentation day. Internet connectivity may not be possible in class, so if the operation of the project requires access to the Internet (e.g., a tweeting toaster), you should test that it works in advance. Points will be deducted if the project does not work. If the project is site-specific and cannot be brought to class, you must demonstrate it working through a video in class on the day of presentations. (20% of mark)

* What are the future possibilities for this project?

* Any code used in the project must be zipped and included with the final pdf. Other formats will not be marked. ZIP only.

* The final project is estimated to require a minimum of 40 hours to complete, but probably more. These are the minimum project requirements. Minimal projects will receive minimal marks. Projects that use more actuators or sensors than the minimum requirement will receive better marks. Exceptional projects may receive distinction.
